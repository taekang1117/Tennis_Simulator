# Tennis_Simulator

A simulation tool designed to predict key statistical outcomes and ultimately a weighted 'score' for players in a tennis match, based on theoretical models and player specific parameters.

## Features

The Tennis Simulator currently focuses on predicting the following aspects of a tennis match:

### 1. Predict Total Double Faults (DF)

This module estimates the total number of double faults a player is likely to hit during a match.

**Methodology:**
We utilize the Poisson distribution, which is suitable for modeling the number of discrete events occurring within a fixed interval (like a match) when these events happen randomly and at a known average rate. Double faults fit this description well as relatively rare, random occurrences throughout a match.

**Key Parameters Used:**
* DF% (Double Fault Percentage)
* First Serve In%
* Second Serve In%
* Average Points per Game
* Estimated number of service games for the player in the match.

**Rough Theoretical Process:**
1.  Estimate the total number of games expected to be played in the match.
2.  Estimate the number of service games for the specific player (typically assumed to be half the total games).
3.  Assume an average number of points played per game (industry average is around 4.2 points).
4.  Calculate the total estimated service points the player will serve: `Total Service Points = Service Games × Points per Game`.
5.  Calculate the Expected Double Faults: `Expected DF = Total Service Points × DF rate` (where DF rate is derived from DF% and likely applied per service point or second serve point).

### 2. Predict Break Points Won

This module predicts how many break points a player is expected to convert against their opponent's serve.

**Theoretical Formula:**
$$ \text{Expected Break Points Won} = \text{Opponent Service Games} \times \text{Break Point Chances per Game} \times \text{Break Point Conversion Rate} $$

* **Break Point Chances per Game:** This is typically estimated based on the player's ability to win points on the opponent's serve (Return Points Won %). For instance, if a player wins 40% of points on the opponent's serve, they are likely to create roughly 1-2 break points per return game.
* **Break Point Conversion Rate:** This is the percentage of break points faced by the opponent that the player successfully converts into winning the game (industry average is around 40% for ATP players).

**Key Parameters Used (or to be included):**
* Opponent's First Serve In% and First Serve Win%.
* Player's Return Points Won % (can potentially use statistics like ReturnSecondPercent).
* Player's Break Point Conversion % (This parameter may need to be explicitly included or estimated).

**Rough Theoretical Process:**
1.  Estimate the number of return games the player will play (typically half the total games).
2.  Estimate the number of break points the player is likely to create per return game based on their return statistics.
3.  Multiply the estimated total break points created by the player's expected break point conversion rate.

*Note: Similar to double faults, a Poisson model could be used here to determine the probability of winning a certain number of break points (e.g., probability of winning more than 2.5 break points).*

### 3. Predict Total Games Played

This module estimates the total number of games that will constitute the match.

**Theoretical Approach:**
The total number of games in a match is primarily driven by its competitiveness, specifically the interplay between players' ability to hold serve and break serve.
* Matches where both players hold serve easily tend to have more games (e.g., sets ending 7-5, 7-6).
* Matches with frequent service breaks tend to have fewer games (e.g., sets ending 6-2, 6-3).
The core relationship is that a player's Hold Rate is approximately `1 - (Opponent's Break Rate)`.

**Key Parameters Used (or to be included):**
* Player's Service Hold % (This can be estimated from underlying serve statistics like Ace%, DF%, First Serve Win%, Second Serve Win%).
* Opponent’s Return Performance (e.g., Return Second Serve %).
* Surface effect (Faster surfaces generally favor servers, leading to higher hold rates and potentially more games if serves dominate).

**Rough Theoretical Process:**
1.  Estimate the service hold rate for each player based on their parameters and the opponent's return performance.
2.  Simulate the match set by set using these estimated serve/hold probabilities.
3.  Compute the expected number of games per set from the simulation outcomes.
4.  Sum the expected games over the predicted number of sets to arrive at the total expected games for the match.

*Simple Estimation Guideline:*
* A predicted one-sided match (e.g., resulting in scores like 6-2, 6-3) might have around 18 games.
* A predicted close match (e.g., resulting in scores like 7-6, 6-7) might have around 26-28 games.
The model aims to predict the match competitiveness to inform the total games estimation.

### 4. Predict Ultimate Score (Custom Weighted Score)

This module calculates a custom weighted score for a player based on the aggregated outcomes of the match.

**Scoring System:**
* +1 point for each game won by the player.
* -1 point for each game lost by the player.
* +3 points for each set won by the player.
* -3 points for each set lost by the player.
* +0.5 points for each ace hit by the player.
* -0.5 points for each double fault hit by the player.

**Theoretical Formula:**
$$ \text{Ultimate Score} = (\text{Games Won} - \text{Games Lost}) + 3 \times (\text{Sets Won} - \text{Sets Lost}) + 0.5 \times (\text{Aces}) - 0.5 \times (\text{Double Faults}) $$

Where:
* `Games Won`: Total games won by the player throughout the match.
* `Games Lost`: Total games lost by the player (total games won by the opponent) throughout the match.
* `Sets Won`: Total sets won by the player.
* `Sets Lost`: Total sets lost by the player (total sets won by the opponent).
* `Aces`: Total aces hit by the player in the match.
* `Double Faults`: Total double faults hit by the player in the match.
