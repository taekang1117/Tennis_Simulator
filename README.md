1. Predict Total Double Faults (DF)
   Use Poisson Distribution
   * double faults happen randomly, but at a certain rate
   * poisson is good for counting rare events (e.g. 5 double faults per match, 2 per set)

Key paramters to include
* DF%
* First Serve In%
* Second Serve In%
* Aerage Points per Game
* Estimated number of service games: how many games a player is expected to serve (depends on total games)

Rough Theoretical Process
a. Estimate total games played (say 24 games in a match).
b. Estimate service games for player (half the games).
c. Assume ~4 points per game (industry average ~4.2 points).
d. So total service points = service games × points per game.
e. Then, Expected DF = Total Service Points × DF rate

2. Predict Break Points Won
   Theoretical Formula: Expected Break Points Won = Opponent Service Games × Break Point Chances per Game×Break Point Conversion Rate
   Where:
   Break Point Chances per Game:
   Normally estimated from return points won.
   If a player wins 40% of opponent's service points → will create ~1-2 break points per return game.
   Break Point Conversion Rate: % of break points actually won (industry average ~40% for ATP).

   Key Parameters to Include:
    Opponent's First Serve In% and First Serve Win%.
    Return Points Won % (could use ReturnSecondPercent you just added).
    Player's Break Point Conversion % (you'll need to add this later).

    Rough Theoretical Process:
    Estimate return games played (half total games).
    Estimate break points created per return game using Return % stats.
    Multiply by expected conversion rate.
    Again, you can use Poisson model if you want probability of "winning more than 2.5 break points."

3. Predict Total Games Played
   Theoretical Formula:
   Total games are driven by match competitiveness:
   * if players hold serve easily -> more games
   * if there are many breaks -> fewer games
    you could odel it based on hold percentages: Hold Rate = 1 - (Break Rate)

  Key Parameters to Include:
    Player's Service Hold % (can be estimated from Ace%, DF%, First Serve Win%, Second Serve Win%).
    Opponent’s Return Performance (Return Second Serve %).
    Surface effect (faster surfaces = higher hold rates).

  Rough Theoretical Process:
    Estimate each player’s hold rate.
    Simulate sets based on serve/hold probabilities.
    Compute expected games per set.
    Sum over sets to get total expected games.

  For simple estimation:
  If match is one-sided (e.g., 6-2, 6-3) → ~18 games.
  If match is close (e.g., 7-6, 6-7) → ~26-28 games.
  Use your model to predict competitiveness ➔ Total Games.

  4. Predict Ultimate Score (Custom Weighted Score)
   +1 point for game win
   -1 point for game loss
   +3 points for set win
   -3 points for set loss
   +0.5 point per ace
   -0.5 point per double fault

Theoretical Formula: 
  Ultimate Score = (G_w - G_l) + 3(S_w - S_i) + 0.5(Aces) - 0.5(Double Faults)
